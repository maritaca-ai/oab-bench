# OAB-Bench
| [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21202) | [**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maritaca-ai/oab-bench) |

OAB-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on legal writing tasks, specifically designed for the Brazilian Bar Examination (OAB). The benchmark comprises 105 questions across seven areas of law from recent editions of the exam.

- OAB-Bench evaluates LLMs on their ability to write legal documents and answer discursive questions
- The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluation guidelines used by human examiners
- Results show that frontier models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet can achieve passing grades (â‰¥6.0) in most exams
- The evaluation pipeline uses LLMs as automated judges, achieving strong correlation with human scores

## Installation

The codebase is based on [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and can be installed via pip:

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/maritaca-ai/oab-bench.git

# Or install from local source
git clone https://github.com/maritaca-ai/oab-bench.git
cd oab-bench
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The benchmark evaluation pipeline consists of three main scripts:

1. Generate model responses for a specific model:
```bash
export MARITACA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

python3 -m gen_api_answer \
    --model sabia-3-2024-12-11 \
    --api-base "https://chat.maritaca.ai/api" \
    --api-key $MARITACA_API_KEY \
    --parallel 10
```

2. Generate automated evaluations using an LLM judge:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

python3 -m gen_judgment \
    --judge-model o1-2024-12-17 \
    --model-list sabia-3-2024-12-11 \
    --parallel 10
```

3. Visualize results:
```bash
python show_result.py --bench-name oab_bench --judge-model o1-2024-12-17
```

## Results

Our evaluation of four LLMs on OAB-Bench shows:

| Model | Average Score | Passing Rate | Best Area |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o3 | 8.88 | 100% | Administrative Law (9.60) |
| Claude-3.5 Sonnet | 7.93 | 100% | Constitutional Law (8.43) |
| SabiÃ¡-3.1 | 7.10 | 76% | Civil Law (7.88) |
| GPT-4o | 6.87 | 86% | Civil Law (7.42) |
| SabiÃ¡-3 | 6.55 | 71% | Labor Law (7.17) |
| Qwen2.5-72B | 5.21 | 24% | Civil Law (5.48) |

The LLM judge (o1) shows strong correlation with human scores when evaluating approved exams, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranging from 0.04 to 0.28 across different law areas.
